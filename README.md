# kvm-introvirt

IntroVirt KVM module. Intel CPUs have full support. AMD CPUs are lacking support for breakpoints but syscall tracing should work.

## Installation Instructions

kvm-introvirt can installed from prebuilt debian packages for Ubuntu 18.04, 22.04, or 24.04. The latest deb packages can be downloaded from the releases.

1. Download the latest `.deb` package for your OS and kernel version
1. Shut down any running VMs
1. Change to the download directory
1. Run: `sudo apt install ./kvm-introvirt-<version>.deb`

If you cannot find a deb package that matches your OS or kernel version, see below how to build and patch yourself. Feel free to submit a PR for a working patch for a new OS/kernel.

## Build Instructions

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        bc devscripts quilt git flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev debhelper \
        linux-source-$(uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1) \
        linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
        linux-modules-$(uname -r)
    ```

1. Clone and build the module (assuming the branch exists for your kernel)

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/IntroVirt/kvm-introvirt.git
    cd ./kvm-introvirt

    # If configure says the kernel is unsupported, see the next section on supporting a new kernel
    ./configure

    make
    sudo make install
    ```

    _NOTE: The patched version of `kvm.ko`, `kvm-intel.ko`, and `kvm-amd.ko` are installed to `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/introvirt/`_

1. Reload the KVM module

    ```bash
    sudo rmmod kvm-intel kvm
    sudo modprobe kvm-intel
    ```

If there are issues/errors loading the modified version of KVM, check `dmesg` for more details. To undo these changes and get the original version of KVM back:

```bash
sudo rmmod kvm-intel kvm
sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/introvirt/
sudo depmod -a $(uname -r)
sudo modprobe kvm-intel
```

## Supporting a new kernel version

To support a new version, reset the environment and create a new branch.

```bash
# Cleans up the kernel folder
make distclean
git reset --hard
git clean -x -d -f
git checkout -b ubuntu/$(lsb_release -sc)/Ubuntu-hwe-$(uname -r)

# Set your email/name to be used in the changelog which is updated by ./configure
# if those variables are set
export DEBEMAIL="<your_email>"
export DEBFULLNAME="<your name>"

# Run configure to pull the kernel source into ./kernel and attempt to apply the patch
./configure
```

When running `./configure`, quilt will attempt to apply the patch to the new target kernel. If the patch does not cleanly apply, you will need to update it. When the patch fails to apply, we need to force apply what we can:

```bash
quilt push -a -f
```

This will apply the parts of the patch that didn't fail, and create `*.rej` files for the parts that failed. Now, manually inspect the `*.rej` files and adapt them into the source to include the changes required for the patch to work. This is a manual process that requires testing/validation that the changes work as intended. Depending on how much the kernel changed, it could be a simple fix, or a more complicated process.

Once done, or if the patch applied successfully in the first place:

```bash
# Update the .patch file with the changes (if any) to the patch
quilt refresh
# Rename the patch for this kernel. For HWE:
quilt rename kvm-introvirt-hwe-$(uname -r)
# For non HWE:
quilt rename kvm-introvirt-$(uname -r)
# Update the header to specify the new kernel version we patched
quilt header -e
# Build it
make
# Build the .deb package
make package
# Install the modified KVM kernel module
sudo make install
# Load it
sudo rmmod kvm-intel kvm
sudo modprobe kvm-intel
# Test it - then un-apply the patch
quilt pop
```

Use `dmesg` for more information if `modprobe` fails.

### Finalize new version support

1. Add and commit changes, then push up the new branch (on a fork) and submit a PR
